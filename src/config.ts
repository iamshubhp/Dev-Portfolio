Hi, I'm Shubh Patel, a passionate Data Science and Machine Learning Engineer and a full-time Computer Science student. My journey into AI and Data Science started in my early university years when I worked on a small project analyzing trends in student performance data. I was fascinated by how raw numbers could be transformed into meaningful insights, and from that moment, I knew I wanted to dive deeper into machine learning, algorithms, and statistical analysis.

<br >As a student balancing coursework and real-world experience, I‚Äôve worked on various projects involving predictive modeling, data visualization, and AI-driven automation. Whether it‚Äôs optimizing datasets for insights or building models to solve practical problems, I love the challenge of working with complex data.

I specialize in developing machine learning models, creating AI pipelines, and deploying scalable solutions. My tech stack includes Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, SQL, and cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

<br> When I‚Äôm not coding, I‚Äôm exploring new advancements in AI, cloud engineering, and data engineering to stay ahead of industry trends.

<br> Beyond tech, I have a huge passion for traveling and exploring new places. `,
